# Image Processing Application: Filtering and Edge Detection

In this project, we have implemented a variety of features to help you manipulate and analyze images. Here's what our application can do:

1. **Noise Addition**: Add different types of additive noise to your images, including Uniform, Gaussian, and Salt & Pepper noise.

2. **Noise Filtering**: Clean up your noisy images using our implemented low pass filters, such as Average, Gaussian, and Median filters.

3. **Edge Detection**: Highlight the important structures in your image using our edge detection feature. We support various edge detection masks including Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, and Canny.

4. **Histogram and Distribution Curve**: Analyze the pixel intensity distribution of your images with our histogram and distribution curve feature.

5. **Histogram Equalization**: Improve the contrast of your images using our histogram equalization feature.

6. **Image Normalization**: Adjust the range of pixel intensity values in your images with our normalization feature.

7. **Thresholding**: Segment your images using our local and global thresholding features.

8. **Color to Grayscale Conversion**: Convert your color images to grayscale and analyze the distribution of R, G, and B channels with our color to grayscale conversion feature.

9. **Frequency Domain Filters**: Apply high pass and low pass filters in the frequency domain to your images.

10. **Hybrid Images**: Create interesting visual effects by generating hybrid images.

Our application is user-friendly and efficient, making it a great tool for both beginners and professionals in image processing. Try it out now. Just double-click to open an image and see the difference!
